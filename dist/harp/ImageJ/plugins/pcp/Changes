ImageJ Plugins Control Panel

Author: Cezar M. Tigaret <c.tigaret@ucl.ac.uk>

Current version is 0.4b

For detailed changes in the code, please look at the comments in the source files.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Version 0.4b - GUI enhancements
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Thursday 21 August 2001 - Saturday 01 September 2001

- Added a button in the top right of the control panel that pops up a menu for
navigation and help; this replaces the popup menu from the older versions.

- Added "Help" and "About" menu items to the popup menu. The "About" menuitem displays
the current plugins version in ImageJ's console.

- The row of tabs in the Tabbed Control Panel (GUI for Java 1) is now scrollable (to left or 
right) by keeping the (left) mouse button pressed on the appropriate arrow tab.

- Accessing the help file(s) through the panel(s) does not depend on the name of the pcp
directory anymore i.e., this directory can now be renamed as it best suits the user.

-The Tree Control Panel now has a "Help" menu  with two items:
	"Help/Contents" - calls a short descriptive help file (html format); replaces the
former "Help" button.
	"Help/About" - prints the version of Plugins_Control_Panel on ImageJ's console.

- Bugs and limitations: 
	* when an arrow tab reappears (after it has been "scrolled-out") it shows as if it was
pressed, although the functionality is preserved; the normal graphic status is restored by
hovering with the mouse over the arrow tab.
	* when scrolling the tabs, a java.lang.NoClassDefFoundError is sometimes thrown; 
this does not seem to affect the functionality of the plugin
	* jumping to a page via the popup menu does not result in a tab panel scroll (i.e., does
not bring the active tab into the tabpanel viewport)

Version 0.4a
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
1) Fixed bug (hopefully) in v 0.4 class loading mechanism for Java 1 version of the code on Windows platform.

2) The popup menu in the tabbed control panel (for Java 1 platform) is back: 
it is called by the (left) mouse button pressed in the narrow space between 
the tabs row and the button panels; the pop-up menu is also available for MacOS users.

3) The tabbed control panel (Java 1 platform) lays out the buttons in a scroll panel; users can now
resize the control panel for screen estate, and still have access all the buttons on the page
using the scroll bars.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Version 0.4 (not publicly released)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

1) The plugin supports deep hierarchy of plugins directories and accept blanks 
and/or underscores in the directory file names. Plugins that bring their own 
packages are also supported (tested with VolumeJ package by Michael Abramoff, 
Volume Renderer plugin) (since version 0.3). 

2) A new function ("Reload") has been added to the control panel, that re-scans 
the plugins directory so that pre-compiled plugin classes can be installed and 
used immediately without the need to restart ImageJ. The "Reload" button is also 
useful after modifying the "plugins" directory tree structure.

However, the new plugin directory structure will not be reflected in ImageJ "Plugins" 
menu unless ImageJ is restarted.

3) Help on panel usage is now available, for Java2 only. Java 1 users, please rely on this file
 for help.

Version 0.3 (not released):
Bug fixes in class loading mechanism: the plugins classes are 
loaded independently of ImageJ; allows for blanks in directory names; allows for
plugin packages.
