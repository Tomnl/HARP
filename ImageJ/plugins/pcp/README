ImageJ Plugins Control Panel

Author: Cezar M. Tigaret <c.tigaret@ucl.ac.uk>

Version 0.4b

INTRODUCTION
============

This plugin allows access to classes installed in a hierarchical subdirectory tree of
the main "plugins" root directory of your ImageJ installation.

Depending on the version of your Java platform, ImageJ user plugins will be accessed from 
one of the two GUI versions (they are automatically selected at runtime):
a) a tabbed control panel (Java 1)
b) a tree control panel (Java 2 SE, version 1.3)

NB! The tree control panel will NOT run on Java 1 platform, even if Swing components 
(Java Foundation Classes) are installed on your system.

Most ImageJ plugins can be installed in subdirectories according to a simple
clasification criterion (for an example, look at ImageJ plugins web page 
(http://rsb.info.nih.gov/ij/plugins/index.html) respecting the naming conventions set
by Wayne Rasband.

VolumeJ (by Michael Abramoff) is an exception in that it brings its own package and must be
installed in the "plugins" directory. 


The tabbed control panel - for users of Java 1.1.x
--------------------------------------------------
The tabbed control panel is a multi-page dialog with each plugins subdirectory on each page;
plugins are launched using buttons contained in the page corresponding to their directory,
selectable using one of the tabs in the top row of the panel. 
A pop-up menu is available by pressing the left mouse button on the narrow space under
the row of tabs (just above the button panels).

The panel supports more than one level of directory branching. However, the control panel 
will display one row of tabs, regardless of the directory tree depth. Subdirectories are 
shown as pages immediately following the page of the parent directory.

The code has been written according to Java 1 specifications, without Swing components, 
so it should be possible to launch it on any platform capable to run ImageJ 1.1.9

The tree control panel - for users of Java 1.3.x
-------------------------------------------------
- The tree control panel shows the "plugins" directory hierarchical structure as a tree; 
plugins are launched by double-clicking on the corresponding tree "leaves". 

- Users can install pre-compiled plugin classes or rename plugin subdirectories and use 
the plugins immediately after pressing the "Reload" button.

- A short help on panel usage is available from within the panel ("Help" button).



NOTES FOR IMAGEJ PLUGIN DEVELOPERS
==================================

The Plugins_Control_Panel employs the same mechanism by which ImageJ custom class loader 
calls plugin main classes: it relies on the presence of underscores in their classnames. 
This mechanism also makes the distinction between these classes (which may appear in the 
ImageJ Plugins menu) from their their dependencies, inner classes (which should not appear
in the ImageJ Plugins menu). 

Please note that this plugin now supports classes bundled in packages.

Please see the "INSTALL" file for installation instructions.

After installation, a "pcp-0.4a" submenu with "Plugins Control Panel" menu item should appear
in the Plugins menu of the main ImageJ window.


Code was originally inspired from ij.plugin.frame.ControlPanel by Wayne Rasband,
the author of ImageJ (http://rsb.info.nih.gov/ij).

BUGS and LIMITATIONS:
=====================
The subdirectory names should not contain ".class" string.
The "Reload" function does not refresh the ImageJ's "Plugins" menu; therefore, newly installed plugins
will only be available through the panel, unless ImageJ is restarted.
Please see also the "Changes" file for bugs and limitations related to the current version.
